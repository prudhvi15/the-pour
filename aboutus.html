            <p id="about" style="color: white">It all started back in 2013 when I happened to visit a coffee shop and ordered latte having no idea what it was. I didn't like the taste cz I never had coffee till that day but, I was fascinated by the way that latte was presented. A shiny cup was coming towards me... While the hands bringing it had a slight wobble, crema over the brim followed the rhythm. It was beautiful with the crema art surrounded by perfectly brewed coffee raised just a little above the brim. .
                    .
                    I got home that day and learnt - what made that cup of latte different? Why was it that fascinating? What happens behind a latte? Even before learning all the science behind it, I started making coffee. With in my limitations, I continued making lattes whenever I can and that journey got me here today. I still don't have fancy machines at home and every latte I make is hand crafted. I am still learning my way around to get better.
                    My people always encouraged and appreciated my stupid paintings on lattes, and made me start show-casing my journey through this profile.
                    My lattes are not perfect, join me while I learn more and enjoy the transformation towards the perfect one! </p>
